# Database Management Systems Final Project
For this project, I was tasked with creating a robust database that met several relationship and entity requirements.

I decided to create a database of the NBA, including all of the players to be selected as an All Star in the 21/22 NBA season. I created tables for players, coaches, teams, owners, arenas, and conferences.

This repository includes screenshots of the individual tables, ER diagrams, my report and presentation, and the schema and data SQL files. The database was created using Oracle.
